### Local Development

For local development, you can clone this repository locally and run the following commands to set up a virtual environment and install the required dependencies. You must have python installed on your machine.

You can use your preferred method of creating a virtual environment, but we recommend using the builtin `venv`:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip3 install -r requirements.txt

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements-dev.txt
